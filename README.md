# Hello, JetBrains!

## The task

Create an app, which will create a single-window filled with color #25854b on startup. On mouse clicked a triangle should appear in the window. One of the triangleâ€™s vertices should match with the cursor position. When the mouse is moved with the button pressed, the triangle should move with the cursor. The application should finish correctly on the closing window via window manager and should not break with a segfault on changing window dimensions.
